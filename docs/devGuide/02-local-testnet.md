# Local testnet

A local testnet is a network consisting of nodes virtually created by you on your machine.

The local testnet could be a good idea if you need to:

- test how the network works,
- run autotests for your DApps, or
- customize your node to satisfy your needs.

Before using the local testnet, you need to build and start the node from [source code](../build-and-start-a-node/02-startingTpNode_source.md) or [Docker image](../build-and-start-a-node/01-startingTpNode_docker.md).

Use our [guide](./03-testnet-start.md) to start your local testnet.
